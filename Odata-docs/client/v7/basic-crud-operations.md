# Basic CRUD Operations

**Applies To**: [!INCLUDE[appliesto-odataclient](../../includes/appliesto-odataclient-v7.md)]

## Add an entity
```csharp
var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri("https://services.odata.org/V4/(S(y5tuj04bxbfsxzimbxbnauqg))/TripPinServiceRW/"));
    var person = Person.CreatePerson("russell", "Russell", "Whyte", new long());
    context.AddToPeople(person);

    context.SaveChanges();
```

## Request an entity set

```csharp
var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri("https://services.odata.org/v4/(S(lqbvtwide0ngdev54adgc0lu))/TripPinServiceRW/"));

var people = context.People.Execute();
```

The `Execute()` API call will return an `IEnumerable<Person>`.

## Request an individual entity

Either use the `Where()` API call:

```c#
var people = context.People.Where(c => c.UserName == "russellwhyte");
foreach (var person in people)
{
    // business logic
}
```
or use the `Where()` with `First()` or `Single()` API call:

```c#
var person = context.People.Where(c => c.UserName == "russellwhyte").First();
var person = context.People.Where(c => c.UserName == "russellwhyte").Single();
```
Note that `First()` will return one object, even if the lambda expression matches multiple objects.
`Single()` always return one object and will throw an exception if the lambda expression matches multiple objects.

Both `First()` and `Single()` will throw an exception if no person with `UserName` as `russelwhyte` exists.

or use the `ByKey()` API:

```C#
var person = context.People.ByKey(userName: "russellwhyte").GetValue();
```

or

```C#
var person = context.People.ByKey(new Dictionary<string, object>() {{"UserName", "russellwhyte"}}).GetValue();
```

The `person` object returned are all of the type `Person`.

## Update an entity

``` csharp
var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri("https://services.odata.org/v4/(S(lqbvtwide0ngdev54adgc0lu))/TripPinServiceRW/"));

var person = context.People.ByKey(userName: "russellwhyte").GetValue(); // get an entity
person.FirstName = "Ross"; // change its property
context.UpdateObject(person); // create an update request

context.SaveChanges(); // send the request
```

Please be noted that the request is not sent until you call the `SaveChanges()` API. The `context` will track all the changes you make to the entities attached to it (by getting `person` from the service you attached it to the `context`) and will send requests for the changes when `SaveChanges` is called.

The sample above will send a `PATCH` request to the service in which the body is the whole `Person` containing properties that are unchanged. There is also a way to track the changes on the property level to only send changed properties in an update request. It will be introduced in later posts.

## Delete an entity

``` csharp
var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri("https://services.odata.org/v4/(S(lqbvtwide0ngdev54adgc0lu))/TripPinServiceRW/"));

var person = context.People.ByKey(userName: "russellwhyte").GetValue(); // get an entity
context.DeleteObject(person); // create a delete request

context.SaveChanges(); // send the request
```

## Handling Exceptions in OData Client
OData Client has implemented a number of `Exception` classes including `DataServiceQueryException` and `DataServiceClientException`. Below is an example of how `Exception`s can be handled while using OData Client.

``` csharp
 try
 {
    //Code that throws exception from the service
 }
 catch (DataServiceQueryException ex)
 {
     //Client level Exception message
     Console.WriteLine(ex.Message);

     //The InnerException of DataServiceQueryException contains DataServiceClientException
     DataServiceClientException dataServiceClientException = ex.InnerException as DataServiceClientException;
     Console.WriteLine(dataServiceClientException.Message);

     // You can get ODataErrorException from dataServiceClientException.InnerException
     // This object holds Exception as thrown from the service
     // ODataErrorException contains odataErrorException.Message contains a message string that conforms to dotnet
     // Exception.Message standards
     ODataErrorException odataErrorException = dataServiceClientException.InnerException as ODataErrorException;
     
     if(odataErrorException != null)
     {
       Console.WriteLine(odataErrorException.Message);
     }  
 }
```
## Using with POCO's

While developing, you may want to use OData Client without a code generation tool like _ODataConnectedService_. In this case, one can still use the OData Client
to access their service.

In order to do this you simply extend the `DataServiceContext` class in your code and add some convenience methods as shown below:

```csharp
// Person class with Odata annotations
[Key('Id')]
public class Person
{
        public string Id { get; set; }
        public string UserName { get; set; }
        public string FirstName { get; set; }
        public string LastName { get; set; }
}

// Dataservice context
 public class Container : DataServiceContext
{
    public Container(Uri serviceRoot) : base(serviceRoot)
    {
              this.People = base.CreateQuery<Person>("People");
    }

    public DataServiceQuery<Person> People { get; }

    public void AddToPeople(Person person)
    {
       base.AddObject("People", person);
    }
}

```

To add new objects to the peoples entity set use `context.AddObject("People", person)` or create a convenience method in the class to do the same.

### Loading the service model

This example allows you to use the client while using the current metadata which is fetched from network. In some cases this is not convenient and to override this behavior you need to change the constructor of the DataService context to include an action that can be used to fetch the model. Codegen tools do this by downloading the metadata and storing it in a verbatim string or a separate file which is then read upon instantiation of the context.

To provide the same for our code we need to do the following.

```csharp
    // ctor from above
    public Container(Uri serviceRoot) : base(serviceRoot)
    {
        this.People = base.CreateQuery<Person>("People");
        // add the following lines
        this.Format.LoadServiceModel = () => util.GetEdmModel()  /* user action that returns a valid IEdmModel instance */  
        this.Format.UseJson(); /* this instruction causes the model to be loaded instantly else the model is loaded lazily and cached when its needed */
    }

```

Using the above method one can switch the model they want to use useful especially when writing tests.

**Note**: Using the OData Connected Service is the recommended way to utilize all the new features in the OData Client.
