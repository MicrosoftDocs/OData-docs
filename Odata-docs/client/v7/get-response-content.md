# Get Response Content
**Applies To**: [!INCLUDE[appliesto-odataclient](../../includes/appliesto-odataclient-v7.md)]

In [Basic CRUD operations](/odata/client/v7/basic-crud-operations) page, we looked at how to carry out basic CRUD operations using the OData Client. In this page, we'll go ahead and drill a little deeper into how to handle the response object for each of these operations. We'll start with data modification responses for create, update and delete operations. We'll also look at query operations for read operations.

## Data modification response
We get a `Data Modification Response` after calling cache updating functions like `UpdateObject` and then `SaveChanges()` or  `SaveChangesAsync()`.

Changes are tracked in the [DataServiceContext](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataservicecontext) instance but not sent to the server immediately. After you are finished with the required changes for a specified activity, call [SaveChanges](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataservicecontext.savechanges) to submit all the changes to the odata service. `SaveChanges` will send a either a "POST", “PUT”, "PATCH" or “DELETE” request.

How changes are submitted to the odata service depends on the [SaveChangesOptions](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.savechangesoptions) flag passed to the `SaveChanges()` method. The examples below will submit changes as a batch request to the odata service.

```csharp
context.SaveChanges(SaveChangesOptions.BatchWithIndependentOperations);
context.SaveChanges(SaveChangesOptions.BatchWithSingleChangeset);
```

A [DataServiceResponse](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataserviceresponse) object is returned after the `SaveChanges` operation is complete. The `DataServiceResponse` object includes a sequence of OperationResponse objects that, in turn, contain a sequence of `EntityDescriptor` or `LinkDescriptor` instances that represent the changes persisted or attempted. When an entity is created or modified in the data service, the EntityDescriptor includes a reference to the updated entity, including any server-generated property values, such as the generated ID value.

When the service doesn't respond with `204 No Content` to data modification requests, the response contains a non-empty body. The code below helps to retrieve the body content:

``` csharp
static void Main(string[] args)
{
    var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri("https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/"));

    var person = Person.CreatePerson("russell", "Russell", "Whyte", new long());

    context.AddToPeople(person);

    DataServiceResponse responses = context.SaveChanges();

    foreach (OperationResponse response in responses)
    {
        var changeResponse = (ChangeOperationResponse) response;
        var entityDescriptor = (EntityDescriptor) changeResponse.Descriptor;
        var personCreated = (Person) entityDescriptor.Entity; // the person created on the service
    }
}
```
The `DataServiceResponse` has the following properties that enable you to access additional information about a modification response:

- [BatchHeaders](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataserviceresponse.batchheaders) - contains headers from an HTTP response associated with a batch request.
- [BatchStatusCode](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataserviceresponse.batchstatuscode)- contains status code from an HTTP response associated with a batch request.
- [IsBatchResponse](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataserviceresponse.isbatchresponse) - gets a Boolean value that indicates whether the response contains multiple results.

The `DataServiceResponse` is enumerated to retrieve responses to operations being tracked by [OperationResponse](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.operationresponse) objects within the `DataServiceResponse`.

## Query Responses
We get a [QueryOperationResponse](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.operationresponse) after calling `Execute()` or `ExecuteAsync()` on [DataServiceQuery&lt;TElement&gt;](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataservicequery-1).
Calling `Execute()` will send a "GET" request.

When executed, the [DataServiceQuery&lt;TElement&gt;](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.dataservicequery-1) returns an `IEnumerable<T>` of the requested entity type. This query result can be cast to a [QueryOperationResponse&lt;T&gt;](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.queryoperationresponse-1) object, as in the following example:
```csharp
var context = new DefaultContainer(new Uri("https://services.odata.org/v4/TripPinServiceRW/"));
DataServiceQuery<Person> query = context.People;
// Execute the query for all customers and get the response object.
QueryOperationResponse<Person> response =
    query.Execute() as QueryOperationResponse<Person>;
```

The entity type instances that represent entities in the data service are created on the client by a process called object materialization. `The QueryOperationResponse<T>` object implements `IEnumerable<T>` to provide access to the results of the query.

The `QueryOperationResponse<T>` also has the following members that enable you to access additional information about a query result:

- [Error](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.operationresponse.error) - gets an error thrown by the operation, if any has occurred.
- [Headers](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.operationresponse.headers)- contains the collection of HTTP response headers associated with the query response.
- [Query](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.queryoperationresponse.query) - gets the original `DataServiceQuery<TElement>` that generated the `QueryOperationResponse<T>`.
- [StatusCode](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.operationresponse.statuscode) - gets the HTTP response code for the query response.
- [TotalCount](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.queryoperationresponse.totalcount) - gets the total number of entities in the entity set when the `IncludeTotalCount` method was called on the `DataServiceQuery<TElement>`.
- [GetContinuation](/dotnet/api/microsoft.odata.client.queryoperationresponse.getcontinuation) - returns a `DataServiceQueryContinuation` object that contains the URI of the next page of results.
