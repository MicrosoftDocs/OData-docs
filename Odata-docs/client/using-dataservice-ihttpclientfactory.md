# Configuring HttpClient with IHttpClientFactory in Microsoft.OData.Client

This feature was introduced in [OData.NET 8](/odata/odatalib/release-notes/odatalib-8#added-support-for-ihttpclientfactory).

`Microsoft.OData.Client` uses [`HttpClient`](/dotnet/api/system.net.http.httpclient) by default, but this document will guide you on how to configure `HttpClient` by providing settings like timeouts and custom handlers using `IHttpClientFactory`.

## Why Use IHttpClientFactory?

[`IHttpClientFactory`](/dotnet/core/extensions/httpclient-factory) is a feature in .NET Core that helps you manage `HttpClient` instances. Here are some benefits:
- **Automatic Management**: It handles the lifecycle of `HttpClient` instances, preventing issues like socket exhaustion.
- **Configuration**: You can set up policies like retries and timeouts.
- **Dependency Injection**: It integrates with .NET Core's DI system, making it easy to use in your services.

## Getting Started

To customize **`HttpClient`** with `Microsoft.OData.Client`, you can use the `HttpClientFactory` property of `DataServiceContext`. This lets you inject your custom `HttpClient` instance.

### 1. Using Dependency Injection

You can use the [`IHttpClientFactory with .NET`](/dotnet/core/extensions/dependency-injection) to configure and inject `HttpClient` instances. 

> **Note that we use an `empty string` here since `OData Client` does not detect `named clients`.**

Here's how:

```cs
var services = new ServiceCollection();

services.AddHttpClient("", client => // We should use an empty string here since OData Client does not detect named clients.
{
    client.Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(160);
});

var serviceProvider = services.BuildServiceProvider();
var httpClientFactory = serviceProvider.GetRequiredService();

var context = new Container(new Uri("{Your endpoint here. For example, https://localhost:7214/odata}"))
{
    HttpClientFactory = httpClientFactory
};
```

### 2. Create a Custom HttpClientFactory

Alternatively, you can create a custom `HttpClientFactory`:

```cs
public class CustomHttpClientFactory : IHttpClientFactory
{
    private readonly HttpClient _httpClient;

    public CustomHttpClientFactory(HttpClient httpClient)
    {
        _httpClient = httpClient;
    }

    public HttpClient CreateClient(string name)
    {
        return _httpClient;
    }
}
```

Next, create an `HttpClient` instance and set the timeout:

```cs
var httpClient = new HttpClient
{
    Timeout = TimeSpan.FromSeconds(160)
};

var httpClientFactory = new CustomHttpClientFactory(httpClient);

var context = new Container(new Uri("{Your endpoint here. For example, https://localhost:7214/odata}"))
{
    HttpClientFactory = httpClientFactory
};
```

## Conclusion
Using `IHttpClientFactory` with `Microsoft.OData.Client` makes managing and customizing `HttpClient` instances easier. Whether you create a custom `HttpClientFactory` or use the DI system, integrating `HttpClient` with your OData client is straightforward.

Happy coding!
