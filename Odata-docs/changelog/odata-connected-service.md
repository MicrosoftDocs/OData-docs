# OData Connected Service changelog

## Change terminology

Breaking changes it the library fall into one of four categories:

- Improved Performance

We will get better writer performance across the board.

- Introducing Dependency Injection

This feature will substantially increase extensibility, like allowing customers to replace entire components such as the `UriPathParser` with their own implementation. Introducing DI make it much easier to use the same reader/writer settings across the board.

- Removed Legacy Code

There was a lot of vestigial code left around from the OData v1-3 days that weâ€™ve removed.

- Improved API Design

Most of our API improvements fall into the category of namespace simplifications or updating verbiage. The single most impactful change that we made was deciding to merge entity type and complex type in ODataLib. We did this because complex type and entity type are becoming more and more similar in the protocol, but we continue to pay overhead to make things work for both of them.
