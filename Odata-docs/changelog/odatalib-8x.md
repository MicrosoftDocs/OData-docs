# OData lib 8.x changelog

OData lib is loosely used to refer to the following group of OData libraries available on the [Nuget gallery](https://www.nuget.org/packages):

- [Microsoft.OData.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Core)

## [8.0.0-rc.1](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/releases/tag/8.0.0-rc.1)

### [Microsoft.OData.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Core/8.0.0-rc.1)

- Made `ODataUtf8JsonWriter` the default JSON writer implementation to enhance serialization performance. Benchmarks and feedback from some OData users have shown that `ODataUtf8JsonWriter` offers better performance and memory efficiency compared to the current default JsonWriter.
- Changed the `ODataLibraryCompatibility` enum into a flags enum, where each bit represents a different compatibility setting that can enable some legacy serialization behavior.
- Refactored `ODataError`, `ODataErrorDetail` and `ODataInnerError` classes.
  - The `ODataErrorDetail`â€™s `ErrorCode` property updated to Code
  - The initialization of `ODataInnerError` changed to `ODataInnerError(new Dictionary<string, ODataValue>())`
- The `ODataResource.Properties` property type was changed to `IEnumerable<ODataPropertyInfo>` to facilitate metadata reading or writing, even in scenarios where the property lacks a value.
- When writing the `Scale` attribute in XML CSDL, use `variable` in lowercase instead of `Variable`. An enum flag, `UseLegacyVariableCasing`, was added to support the legacy behavior.

### [Microsoft.OData.Edm](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Edm/8.0.0-rc.1)

- Added `UsesDefault` property to `IEdmVocabularyAnnotation` to support creating vocabulary annotations without explicit values but with default values. These default values are not written to the CSDL but can be read.

### [Microsoft.OData.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Client/8.0.0-rc.1)

- Renamed `IBaseEntityType.Context` to `DataServiceContext` to avoid naming conflicts that cause compilation or runtime errors when `Context` is used as a property name in customer schemas.

## [8.0.0-preview.1](https://github.com/OData/odata.net/releases/tag/8.0.0-preview.1)

Starting version 8, OData lib will only target .NET 8 or later.

### [Microsoft.OData.Core](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Core/8.0.0-preview.1)

- `IJsonReaderAsync` interface has been merged into `IJsonReader` interface.
  - Any implementation of `IJsonReader` needs to implement methods previously defined in `IJsonReaderAsync` interfaces.
  - The `Value` property in `IJsonReader` interface is replaced by `GetValue` method.
- `IJsonReaderFactoryAsync` interface has been dropped.
- `IJsonStreamWriter`, `IJsonWriterAsync` and `IJsonStreamWriterAsync` interfaces have been merged into `IJsonWriter` interface.
  - Any implementation of `IJsonWriter` needs to implement methods previously defined in `IJsonStreamWriter`, `IJsonWriterAsync` and `IJsonStreamWriterAsync` interfaces.

  - `AddMessage(ODataUrlValidationMessage)` overload introduced in `ODataUrlValidationContext`.
- `INavigationSourceSegment` interface introduced. The purpose of this new interface is to reduce casting when determining the navigation source associated with the segment. `EntitySetSegment`, `SingletonSegment` and `NavigationPropertySegment` implement this new interface.
- Deprecated support for JSONP callback. Feature to be removed in ODL 9.
  - `JsonPCallback` property defined in `ODataMessageWriterSettings` class marked as obsolete.

  - `WritePaddingFunctionNameAsync` method defined in `IJsonWriter` interface marked as obsolete.
- `ODataSimplifiedOptions` class was dropped. This class would be injected into the DI container and the settings used to control behaviour when parsing URLs, and when writing and reading payloads. In ODL 8, `ODataMessageReaderSettings`, `ODataMessageWriterSettings`, and `ODataUriParserSettings` may variously be used to accomplish the same purpose.
  - `EnableReadingKeyAsSegment` and `EnableReadingODataAnnotationWithoutPrefix` properties moved to `ODataMessageReaderSettings` class.
  - `EnableWritingKeyAsSegment` property moved to `ODataMessageWriterSettings` class.

  - `EnableParsingKeyAsSegment` property moved to `ODataUriParserSettings` class.
- In ODL 7, when `ODataBinaryStreamValue` class is initialized using the `ODataBinaryStreamValue(Stream)` constructor, the stream is left open by default upon the object being disposed. In ODL 8, the stream is closed by default the object objects is disposed. The `ODataBinaryStreamValue(Stream, bool)` constructor overload may be used where leaving the stream open is intended.
- `Func<string, bool> ShouldIncludeAnnotation` property introduced in `ODataMessageWriterSettings`. This property makes it possible for developers to force a custom instance annotation to be written even if it's not include in the optional `@odata.include-annotations` preference token in `Prefer` request header.
- `IContainerBuilder` interface used when registering OData services was dropped. Use `Microsoft.Extensions.DependencyInjection` library instead.
  - `AddDefaultODataServices(IServiceCollection, ODataVersion, Action<ODataMessageReaderSettings>, Action<ODataMessageWriterSettings>, Action<ODataUriParserSettings>)` extension method introduced for the purpose of registering OData services.
  - `IContainerProvider` interface replaced by `IServiceCollectionProvider` interface. It's a provider for the `IServiceProvider` IoC container.
  - `ODataBatchOperationRequestMessage` now implements `IServiceCollectionProvider` instead of `IContainerProvider`.
  - `ODataBatchOperationResponseMessage` now implements `IServiceCollectionProvider` instead of `IContainerProvider`.

### [Microsoft.OData.Client](https://www.nuget.org/packages/Microsoft.OData.Client/8.0.0-preview.1)
- `HttpWebRequestMessage` class has been dropped - effectively dropping support for `HttpWebRequest`. Use `HttpClientRequestMessage` class instead.

- Obsolete `Credentials` property dropped from `DataServiceContext` class. The recommended way to configure credentials is through `HttpClientHandler` that can be provided using `IHttpClientFactory`.
- Obsolete `ReadWriteTimeout` property dropped from `DataServiceClientRequestMessage` abstract class. This property would be used with `HttpWebRequestMessage`. `Timeout` property may be used instead.
- Obsolete `ReadWriteTimeout` property dropped from `HttpClientRequestMessage` class. This property would be used with `HttpWebRequestMessage`. `Timeout` property may be used instead.
- In `DataServiceClientRequestMessageArgs` class, the `DataServiceClientRequestMessageArgs(string, Uri, bool, bool, IDictionary<string, string>)` constructor has changed to `DataServiceClientRequestMessageArgs(string, Uri, bool, IDictionary<string, string>)`. The boolean `useDefaultCredentials` parameter is no longer supported.
- In `DataServiceClientRequestMessageArgs` class, the `DataServiceClientRequestMessageArgs(string, Uri, bool, bool, IDictionary<string, string>, IHttpClientHandlerProvider)` constructor has changed to `DataServiceClientRequestMessageArgs(string, Uri, bool, IDictionary<string, string>, IHttpClientFactory)`. The boolean `useDefaultCredentials` parameter is no longer supported.
