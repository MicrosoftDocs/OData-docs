# Security guidance for ASP.NET Core Web API OData

By Mike Wasson, [FIVIL](https://github.com/fivil)  and [Rick Anderson](https://twitter.com/RickAndMSFT)

This page describes some of the security issues that you should consider when exposing a dataset through [OData](https://www.odata.org/) for ASP.NET Core Web API.

## Query security

Suppose your model includes an `Employee` type with a `Salary` property. You might want to exclude this property to hide it from clients. Properties can be excluded with `[IgnoreDataMember]`:

[!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/Models/Employee.cs?name=snippet)]

A malicious or naive client can construct a query that:

* Takes significant system resources. Such a query can disrupt your service.
* Leaks sensitive information from a clever join.

The `[EnableQuery]` attribute is an action filter that parses, validates, and applies the query. The filter converts the query options into a [LINQ](/dotnet/csharp/linq/) expression. When the controller returns an `System.Linq.IQueryable` type, the `IQueryable` LINQ provider converts the LINQ expression into a query. Therefore, performance depends on the LINQ provider that is used, and on the particular characteristics of the dataset or database schema.

<!-- This could be eventually ported.

-->

If all clients are trusted (for example, in an enterprise environment), or if the dataset is small, query performance might not be an issue. Otherwise, consider the following recommendations:

- Test your service with anticipated queries and profile the DB.
- Enable server-driven paging to avoid returning a large data set in one query. <!--For more information, see [Server-Driven Paging](supporting-odata-query-options.md#server-paging). -->

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/Controllers/ValuesController.cs?name=snippet_PageSize)]

- Does the app require `$filter` and `$orderby`? Some apps might allow client paging, using `$top` and `$skip`, but disable the other query options.

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/Controllers/ValuesController.cs?name=snippet_AllowedQueryOptions)]

- Consider restricting `$orderby` to properties in a clustered index. Sorting large data without a clustered index is resource-intensive.

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/Controllers/ValuesController.cs?name=snippet_AllowedOrderByProperties)]

- Maximum node count: The **MaxNodeCount** property on **[EnableQuery]** sets the maximum number nodes allowed in the `$filter` syntax tree. The default value is 100, but you may want to set a lower value. A large number of nodes can be slow to compile. This is important when using [LINQ to Objects](/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/concepts/linq/linq-to-objects).

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/Controllers/ValuesController.cs?name=snippet_MaxNodeCount)]
- Consider disabling the `any` and `all` functions, as these can be resource-intensive: 

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/Controllers/ValuesController.cs?name=snippet_any)]

- If any string properties contain large strings&#8212;for example, a product description or a blog entry&#8212;consider disabling the string functions.

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/Controllers/ValuesController.cs?name=snippet_large)]

- Consider disallowing filtering on navigation properties. Filtering on navigation properties can result in a join. Joins can be slow, depending on the database schema. The following code shows a query validator that prevents filtering on navigation properties. <!-- For more information about query validators, see [Query Validation](supporting-odata-query-options.md#query-validation). -->

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/ODataAttribute/MyFilterNavPropQueryValidator.cs?name=snippet)]

- Consider restricting `$filter` queries by writing a validator that is customized for the database. For example, consider these two queries:

  - All movies with actors whose last name starts with `A`.
  - All movies released in 1994.

    Unless movies are indexed by actors, the first query might require the DB engine to scan the entire list of movies. Whereas the second query might be acceptable, assuming movies are indexed by release year.

    The following code shows a validator that allows filtering on the `ReleaseYear` and `Title` properties but no other properties.

    [!code-csharp[Main](odata-security/sample/ODataAPI/ODataAttribute/MyFilterQueryValidator.cs?name=snippet)]

- In general, consider which $filter functions are required. If clients don't need the full expressiveness of `$filter`, limit the allowed functions.

## EDM security

The query semantics are based on the [Entity Data Model](https://www.odata.org/documentation/odata-version-2-0/overview/) (EDM), not the underlying model types. You can exclude a property from the EDM and it will not be visible to the query. For example, suppose your model includes an `Employee` type with a `Salary` property. You might want to exclude this property from the EDM to hide it from clients.

Properties can be excluded with `[IgnoreDataMember]` or programmatically with the EDM. The following code removes the `Salary` property from the EDM programmatically:
